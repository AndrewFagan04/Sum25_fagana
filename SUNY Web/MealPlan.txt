Meal exchange is the ability to use meal swipes at select retail locations on campus. Ask a team member in our retail areas for more information!

One meal swipe is good for a specific combo that is listed on the menu at the location. The number of meal exchange swipes you have depends on your meal plan.

 

Unlimited Meal Plan = 10 Meal Exchange swipes per week

Weekly 14 Plan = 5 Meal Exchange swipes per week

Block 160 Plan = 5 Meal Exchange swipes per week


Guest Meals
Five guest meals come with the unlimited meal plan, and two guest meals come with the Weekly 14 and Block 160 plans. They can be used at The Dish to treat a friend to a meal.
